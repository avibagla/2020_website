		<h5 class="tagline">The one where I turn ideas into content</h5>
		<p class="blurb">I'm an internet video producer who has worked for digital media companies you know and love to hate. I've produced and written videos for brands such as BuzzFeed, Mashable, DUST, FailArmy, The Pet Collective (among others). My work is genre-neutral but I specialize in edutainment (What is Schizophrenia Like? (#6 on Trending), Reelistic) and comedy (Demotivational Moments, The Scoop). I have experience directing celebrities for ad campaigns and people who have never seen a camera in their life.  </p>

		<h5 class="tagline">The one where I talk to people for you and make them laugh - online and in person</h5>
		<p class="blurb"> I've been told that I make people laugh and well, I believe them more than I believe me. I've been performing stand up comedy since 2016. I also have appeared in video content for BuzzFeed, FailArmy, the Pet Collective, and run my own YouTube Channel where I make videos and sketches based on political or technical challenges. That's a very long-winded way of saying I tell jokes.</p>
